# phpv8-v8js-ubuntu-nginx
Development boilder plate for running V8 in a container with Nginx on Ubuntu. Not to be used for production.

Configured for php7.4 as I had issues with phpv8 package not supporting php8.1  (as of creation).

Not intended for production use in its current form (password in provision.sh)
